# A very incomplete full stack app intended to help run a tabletop rpg called Scion 2nd Edition.

I was experimenting with ScalaJS, outwatch, laminar, and FRP in general here.

I got far enough that I enjoy the base here, but needed to learn more about the
rules of Scion 2E to know what I would really need to implement, then my wife
and I decided it was time to buy a house and I just haven't had time to get
back to it.
